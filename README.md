This project is a content-based movie recommender system using word vectorization and cosine similarity. To run the notebook code, kindly download the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata'>dataset</a> from Kaggle which is a collection of 5000 TMBD movies data. The model is further embedded in an application based on Streamlit. Also, you need to run the notebook code to create the pickle files required in the Streamlit app.
