This project is a content-based movie recommender system using vectorization and cosine similarity further embedded in the Streamlit App. Before running the notebook code, kindly download the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata'>dataset</a> from Kaggle which is a collection of 5000 TMBD movies data. Also, you need to run the notebook code beforehand to create the pickle files required in the Streamlit app.
